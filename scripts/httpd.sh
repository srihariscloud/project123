Certainly! Below is a simple shell script that you can use to monitor the status of the Apache HTTP Server (httpd) and start the service if it's not running. This script assumes a Linux environment with a system that uses systemctl for service management.

Create a new file, for example, monitor_httpd.sh, and add the following content:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Check if httpd service is running
if systemctl is-active --quiet httpd; then
    echo "HTTPD service is running."
else
    # Start httpd service if it's not running
    echo "HTTPD service is not running. Starting the service..."
    sudo systemctl start httpd

    # Check if the service started successfully
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "HTTPD service started successfully."
    else
        echo "Failed to start HTTPD service. Check the logs for more information."
    fi
